This is a very simple program for beginners who want to practice loops
and conditional statements. It will continue to look for the match
and will break out of the loop once there is the match.

Just see the code and enjoy the simplicity!

## The Good Old Days
PureBasic was my first ever programming language, so it reminds me of the good old days. 
Before PureBasic, I first learned Excel formulas, which really captured my interest. 
The very first time I encountered Excel was in college,
and it was the IF function presented by the professor that really caught my attention.
